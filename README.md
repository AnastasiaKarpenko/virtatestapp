## Test Assignment 

In this project I used :
- React.js, 
- react-google-maps, 
- Webstorm as IDE, 
- Virta API for data

"containers" folder has:
- App.js file which is responsible for holding the map, getting the EV stations list from the server and
holding this data,
- App.css which sets the styles for App.js.

"components" folder has 2 components:
- Marker component that is responsible for handling the marker click and showing EV station's name and EvChargers' status in the info window
- Map component that is responsible for drawing zooming the map and setting the markers
